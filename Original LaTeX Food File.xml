The menus provide four different meals
for each week.
You make a double amount for one meal
and then have the rest for the next meal,
so a micro-wave oven would be useful.
One meal in every seven is some kind of quick
or easily prepared meal.
The ingredients for each menu are accumulated
into a fortnightly shopping list.
The shopping lists
and check lists cover two weeks food
(for main meals)
for two people.
Most of them are one pan meals.
You will need:

\begin{itemize}
	\item 3 litre <Utensil Name="casserole" />.
	\item 2 litre <Utensil Name="pan" />.
	\item 35 cm <Utensil Name="wok" />.
	\item 3 litre mixing bowl.
\end{itemize}

Vegetables will not last for more than about a week,
so there is a mid fortnight vegetable shopping list.
Vegetables will last better if kept in an air tight box,
lined with a tea towel,
in the fridge.
Meat will need to be frozen
and
dairy products will need to be refridgerated.
No other shopping is required.

All measurements using spoons are heaped,
as much as they can be heaped.

\begin{itemize}
	\item[tsp] teaspoon.            % Nominally 5ml
	\item[dsp] dessert spoon.       % Nominally 10ml
	\item[tbsp] table spoon.        % Nominally 20ml
\end{itemize}
